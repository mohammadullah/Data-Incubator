This Notebook shows the statistics of top journals and research topics from 25000 records in PubMed. Here is can wee that, Cancer related research is most dominating. Heath is also important but we need to do more analysis to understand the specific type of health research. Frequency count was done based on the first "word" of a keyword (if one keyword contain two or more words) so only health is not that informative.

In case of journal, large portion of papers from Nature publisher (Scientific reports, Nature Communications)


```{r plot2}

library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

p2 <- ggplot(data = keydf, aes(x = Keywords, y = Freq)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
p2 <- p2 + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5)) 
p2 <- p2 + labs(x = "Keyword", y = "Frequeny", 
                caption = "Figure 2(a): Most used research keywords")

p3 <- ggplot(data = journaldf, aes(x = Journal, y = Freq)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
p3 <- p3 + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5)) 
p3 <- p3 + labs(x = "Journal Name", y = "Frequency", 
                caption = "Figure 2(b): Top Journals based on 
                number of published articles")

p4 <- grid.arrange(p2, p3, ncol = 2)
```
